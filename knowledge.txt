This project is called Splai. It's being developed by Rich Dougherty to
provide AI tools that you can use in software development projects. It's
a bit of an experiment.

One thing that's useful is to bring extra context into the project, such
as knowledge about dependencies or project documentation. This means
part of the project is gathering and indexing this information.

This information can be used by an agent to answer questions about the
project. In the future the agent may be able to help with project
changes or review.

The project uses LangChain (https://langchain.com/) and OpenAI APIs
to implement the agent AI.
